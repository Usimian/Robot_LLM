# **Cosmos-Transfer1: A Suite of Diffusion-based World-to-World Transfer Models**

[**Cosmos**](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/cosmos-transfer1-67c9d328196453be6e568d3e) | [**Code**](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1) | [**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14492) | [**Paper Website**](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/cosmos-transfer1)

# Model Overview

## Description:

**Cosmos-Transfer1 Models**: A family of highly performant pre-trained world foundation models that are designed to generate videos aligned with the input control conditions.

The Cosmos Transfer1 models are a collection of diffusion-based world foundation models that generate dynamic, high quality videos from text and control video inputs. It can serve as the building block for various applications or research that are related to world generation. The models are ready for commercial use.

**Model Developer**: NVIDIA

## Model Versions

The Cosmos Transfer1 model family includes the following models:

- [Cosmos-Transfer1-7B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Cosmos-Transfer1-7B)
  - Given a text prompt and one or multiple (up to four) control input videos -- Canny edge, blurred RGB, segmentation mask, depth map, and human keypoints -- predict a photorealistic output video by leveraging guidance in the control input videos. Automatic extraction is available for edge and blur controls when only an RGB video is provided.

### License:

This model is released under the  [NVIDIA Open Model License](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/enterprise-software/nvidia-open-model-license). For a custom license, please contact [cosmos-license@nvidia.com](mailto:cosmos-license@nvidia.com).

Under the NVIDIA Open Model License, NVIDIA confirms:

* Models are commercially usable.
* You are free to create and distribute Derivative Models.
* NVIDIA does not claim ownership to any outputs generated using the Models or Derivative Models.

**Important Note**: If you bypass, disable, reduce the efficacy of, or circumvent any technical limitation, **safety guardrail** or
associated safety guardrail hyperparameter, encryption, security, digital rights management, or authentication mechanism contained
in the Model, your rights under [NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/enterprise-software/nvidia-open-model-license) will automatically terminate.

### Deployment Geography:

Global

### Use Case:

Physical AI: encompassing robotics, autonomous vehicles (AV), and more.

### Release Date:

03/17/2025

## Model Architecture:

Cosmos-Transfer1-7B is a diffusion transformer model designed for video denoising in the latent space, modulated by multiple control branches with a spatiotemporal control map.

The diffusion transformer network ("the base model") is composed of interleaved self-attention, cross-attention, and feedforward layers as its building blocks. The cross-attention layers allow the model to condition on input text throughout the denoising process. Before each layers, adaptive layer normalization is applied to embed the time information for denoising.

The control branch is formed by replicating the first few transformer blocks of the base model. It processes the control input video to extract control signals, which are then injected into the corresponding transformer blocks of the base model, guiding the denoising process with structured control. When multiple control input videos are provided, each is processed by a dedicated control branch, trained to extract modality-specific control signals. These signals are then combined through a weighted sum and injected into the corresponding transformer blocks in the base model.

## Input/Output Specifications

* **Input**

  * **Input Type(s)**: Text+Video
  * **Input Format(s)**:
    * Text: String
    * Video: mp4
    * Control Input Video: mp4
    * Control Weights: floating-point number, `.pt` file
  * **Input Parameters**:
    * Text: One-dimensional (1D)
    * Video: Three-dimensional (3D)
    * Control Input video: Three-dimensional (3D)
    * Control Weights: One-dimensional (1D) or Three-dimensional (3D)
  * **Other Properties Related to Input**:
    * The input string should contain fewer than 300 words and should provide descriptive content for world generation, such as a scene description, key objects or characters, background, and any specific actions or motions to be depicted within the 5-second duration.
    * The model supports control input videos of varying lengths, but a length which is multiples of 120 frames (e.g., 120, 240, or 360 frames) performs the best.
    * The model supports four types of control input videos: blurred video, Canny edge, depth map, segmentation mask, and human keypoints. When multiple control inputs are provided, they must be derived from the same source video, representing different modalities of the same content while maintaining identical spatio-temporal dimensions.
* **Output**

  * **Output Type(s)**: Video
  * **Output Format(s)**: mp4
  * **Output Parameters**: Three-dimensional (3D)
  * **Other Properties Related to Output**: By default, the generated video is the same length, height, width and frames-per-second (fps) as the input. The video content transforms the input video into a photorealistic scene, following the input text description.
